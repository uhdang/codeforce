# Software Engineering

NOTE: When coding or debugging, try not to fall into a habit of "trying" things out and hope it works. Try to be as systematic and rigorous as possible. Avoid "trial-and-error" approach.

# C++

## Learning
- Skip `return 0`. 15ms faster without it.

## Compilation command (using c++17)
$ g++ -std=c++17 [CPP FILENAME]

## Snippets
- Receive two variables from one-line.
```c++
int a, b;
std::cin >> a >> b;
```

## Reference
- 187A
- 427A: `cin >>` in for loop.
